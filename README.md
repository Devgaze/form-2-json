form-2-json
===========

Lightweight & fast, pure Javascript, plugin for serializing HTML forms as a key/value pair (JSON) object.
The main idea behind this plugin is the ability to understand `dot notation` inside of the `name` attribute, for more meaningful output.

For the sake of simplicity I'll keep this module as simple and light as possible. If you have some ideas, we can discuss about integrating it inside, or you can just fork it and evolve it yourself.
